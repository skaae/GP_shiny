This work does only use the data from \n\\cite{HaibeKains:2012gp} and \\cite{Curtis:2012il}. The TCGA dataset is time \nconsuming and difficult to clean and was therefore left out.\n\nFor \\emph{clinical} data the following critere was used:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Either overall survival or recurrence free survival must be avaible. \n    Overall survival is prefered. \n  \\item Of the following clinical mesurments at most \\Sexpr{nas_cutoff} must be missing:\n      tumor size, nodal involvement, age, tumor grade, treatment, her2 and ER.\\\\\n  \\item her2 and er is allowed to be either measured or infered from genomic data.\n        Measurements are prefferede.\n\\end{itemize}%\n%\nFor \\emph{genomic} data the following critere was used:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Must have clinical data available.\n  \\item The platform must be either Agilent, Affymetrix or Illumina.\n\\end{itemize}%\n%\n\\subsection{normalization and missing values}\nThe target for all training was survival time in days. The following covariates were included in the model\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item age [Continuous, years]\n    \\item her2 receptor status, [Categorical, 0/1]\n    \\item Estrogen receptor status [Categorical, 0/1]\n    \\item Nodal involvement [Continuous, number of nodes]\n    \\item Tumor size [Continuous, cm]\n    \\item Histological grade [Ordinal, 1/2/3]\n    \\item Treatment any [Categorical, 0/1]\n    \\item Treatment Chemo therapy [Categorical, 0/1]\n    \\item Treatment Hormonal therapy [Categorical, 0/1]\n    \\item Treatment Radio therapy [Categorical, 0/1]\n\\end{enumerate}\nContentious and Ordinal covariates were scaled to zero mean and unit variance. Categorical covariates where represented as $\\pm$1 if the number of categories was equal to 2, otherwise \\emph{one Hot} encode, e.g a n category variable would be encoded using a row vector of length n: \n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{matrix} \n\\text{category 1: } & \\text{category 2: } & \\text{category n: } \\\\ \n[1, -1 ...n]         & [-1,1...n]           & [-1,-1...1] \\\\ \n\\end{matrix}\n\\end{equation}\nFor all but random survival models missing covariates were replaced by median values.\n\\fixme{explain survival forest missing value strategy + if I use knnimpute explain} ",
